# üîç Why OCR Didn't Extract All InBody Metrics

## **Reasons OCR Missed Additional Values:**

### **1. Limited Prompt Scope** ‚ùå
**Problem:** The original prompt only listed 10 basic metrics
```
weight, height, bmi, body_fat_percent, skeletal_muscle_mass, 
visceral_fat_level, body_water_percent, protein, mineral, basal_metabolic_rate
```

**Impact:** GPT-4o was instructed to ONLY extract metrics from this specific list, so it ignored everything else even if visible in the image.

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Updated prompt to include all 45+ metrics including segmental data

---

### **2. No Segmental Data Instructions** ‚ùå
**Problem:** Original prompt didn't mention:
- Segmental lean mass (arms, legs, trunk)
- Segmental fat mass
- Segmental analysis percentages

**Impact:** GPT-4o didn't know to look for tables/charts showing body segment breakdowns

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Added explicit instructions to extract segmental data from tables

---

### **3. Missing Metric Categories** ‚ùå
**Problem:** Prompt didn't include:
- Water balance metrics (intracellular, extracellular, ECW ratio)
- Control recommendations (fat control, muscle control)
- Scores (fitness score, InBody score)
- Advanced composition (body cell mass, fat-free mass)

**Impact:** These values were visible but not extracted

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Comprehensive metric list now includes all categories

---

### **4. Visual Layout Complexity** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** InBody reports have complex layouts:
- Multiple columns
- Tables with segmental data
- Charts and graphs
- Small text in different sections

**Impact:** Without specific instructions, GPT-4o focused on the most prominent values

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Added instruction to "look for segmental data in tables/charts"

---

### **5. Translation Ambiguity** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** Polish labels for segmental data:
- "Prawa rƒôka" (Right Arm)
- "Lewa noga" (Left Leg)
- "Tu≈Ç√≥w" (Trunk)

**Impact:** Without translation examples, GPT-4o might not map these correctly

**Fix:** ‚úÖ Added translation examples for segmental terms

---

## **What Changed:**

### **Before (10 metrics):**
```
weight, height, bmi, body_fat_percent, skeletal_muscle_mass,
visceral_fat_level, body_water_percent, protein, mineral, basal_metabolic_rate
```

### **After (45+ metrics):**
```
‚úÖ Basic Composition (13 metrics)
‚úÖ Segmental Lean Mass (5 metrics - arms, legs, trunk)
‚úÖ Segmental Fat Mass (5 metrics)
‚úÖ Segmental Analysis % (5 metrics)
‚úÖ Water Balance (4 metrics)
‚úÖ Nutrition (3 metrics)
‚úÖ Obesity/Control (5 metrics)
‚úÖ Energy/Targets (3 metrics)
‚úÖ Scores (2 metrics)
‚úÖ Impedance (3 metrics - optional)
```

---

## **Expected Improvement:**

### **Previous Extraction:**
- 10 basic values
- No segmental data
- No water breakdown
- No scores

### **New Extraction:**
- 20-30+ values (depending on report)
- Full segmental breakdown
- Water balance details
- Fitness scores
- Control recommendations

---

## **Testing:**

Upload the same InBody image again and you should now see:
- ‚úÖ All basic metrics
- ‚úÖ Segmental lean mass (5 body parts)
- ‚úÖ Segmental fat mass (5 body parts)
- ‚úÖ Water balance (total, intracellular, extracellular)
- ‚úÖ Scores and recommendations

---

## **Why This Matters:**

1. **Complete Tracking** - Track muscle imbalances between limbs
2. **Water Balance** - Monitor hydration and fluid retention
3. **Progress Metrics** - See fitness scores and recommendations
4. **Advanced Analysis** - Body cell mass, ECW ratio, etc.

---

## **Next Steps:**

1. Run the new migration: `20250213_add_extended_metrics.sql`
2. Upload an InBody photo
3. Compare: Should extract 20-30+ values instead of just 10!

üéØ **The OCR will now capture the full InBody report!**
