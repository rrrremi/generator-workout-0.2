# ISOMETRIC Workout Focus Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the ISOMETRIC workout focus in the FitGen application. Isometric training involves static muscle contractions where the muscle length and joint angle do not change during the exercise. This type of training is beneficial for strength gains, rehabilitation, and can be performed with minimal equipment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added ISOMETRIC to Workout Focus Options
Location: `app/protected/workouts/generate/page.tsx`

```tsx
const WORKOUT_FOCUS = [
  { id: 'hypertrophy', label: 'Hypertrophy', icon: Dumbbell, description: 'Build muscle size and strength' },
  { id: 'strength', label: 'Strength', icon: Zap, description: 'Maximize muscle power and force' },
  { id: 'cardio', label: 'Cardio', icon: Activity, description: 'Cardiovascular endurance' },
  { id: 'isolation', label: 'Isolation', icon: Target, description: 'Target specific muscle groups' },
  { id: 'stability', label: 'Stability', icon: Target, description: 'Balance and control focus' },
  { id: 'plyometric', label: 'Plyometric', icon: Zap, description: 'Explosive movements' },
  { id: 'isometric', label: 'Isometric', icon: Target, description: 'Static holds that build strength without movement' },
];
```

### 2. Added Isometric Training Parameters to Workout Prompts
Location: `lib/prompts/workout.ts`

```ts
export const focusInstructions = {
  // Other focus types...
  isometric: "Static holds 10–60s @70–100% max voluntary contraction, 60–180s rest. Focus on position maintenance, muscle tension without movement. Emphasize proper breathing and form.",
};
```

## Isometric Training Specifications

The implementation includes the following specifications for isometric training:

1. **Hold Duration**: 10-60 seconds per set
2. **Intensity**: 70-100% of maximum voluntary contraction
3. **Rest Periods**: 60-180 seconds between sets
4. **Focus Areas**:
   - Position maintenance
   - Muscle tension without movement
   - Proper breathing techniques
   - Correct form

## Example Isometric Exercises

When users select the ISOMETRIC workout focus, the AI will generate exercises such as:

1. **Wall Sit**: A lower body isometric exercise where the user holds a seated position against a wall.
2. **Plank**: Core isometric exercise maintaining a straight-line body position.
3. **Glute Bridge Hold**: Holding the top position of a glute bridge.
4. **Isometric Push-up Hold**: Holding the bottom or middle position of a push-up.
5. **Isometric Pull-up Hold**: Holding the top or middle position of a pull-up.

## User Interface

In the workout generation interface, users can now select "Isometric" as a workout focus option. The UI displays:
- The label "Isometric"
- A target icon representing the focus type
- A description: "Static holds that build strength without movement"

## Technical Implementation

The implementation required changes to:
1. The UI component that displays workout focus options
2. The workout generation prompt system to include isometric training parameters
3. The OpenAI prompt handling to recognize and process isometric training requests

No database schema changes were required as the existing structure already supports different workout focus types.

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- The isometric option appears correctly in the UI
- Selecting isometric focus generates appropriate workouts
- The generated workouts include proper isometric training parameters (hold times instead of repetitions where appropriate)
